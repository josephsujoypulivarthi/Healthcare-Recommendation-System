# Healthcare Recommendation System

This project uses machine learning and neural networks to analyze patient health data and provide personalized healthcare recommendations, focusing on heart disease risk assessment.

## Project Overview

The system uses patient health metrics to predict the risk of heart disease and provides tailored recommendations based on the risk level.

Key features:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature engineering for improved model performance
- Multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- Advanced models with hyperparameter tuning (SVM, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost)
- Neural network implementation
- Interactive web application for risk assessment and recommendations

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`

## Data

The project uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset which includes various patient attributes like:
- Age, gender
- Chest pain type
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- And many other health metrics

## Development Process

1. Data exploration and preprocessing
2. Basic model implementation
3. Feature engineering
4. Advanced model development
5. Neural network implementation
6. Web application development
